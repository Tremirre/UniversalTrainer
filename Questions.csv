Which of the following statements about AdaGrad is incorrect?, AdaGrad can dynamically adjust the learning rate. The more parameters are updated the lower the learning rate, AdaGrad can adjust the learning rate for different parameters., When AdaGrad optimizes the model the learning rate is dynamically adjusted by dividing the learning rate by the root mean square of all gradients of a parameter., #AdaGrad calculates the quadratic differential of a parameter to dynamically adjust the learning rate.
Which of the following statements about dropout is incorrect?, A dropout rate is a hyperparameter., During training the network layer to which dropout is added will randomly discard neurons of dropout rate, If dropout is added to a network layer during training but not during inference the weight value of this layer multiplies (1-dropout rate)., #Dropout can't be added during inference
